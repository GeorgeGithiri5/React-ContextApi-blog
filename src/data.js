    description: "There is much difference between react stateful and stateless components. To start with stateful components data keeps on changing while stateless components only renders static data through props. In react js,stateless Components are much more reusable seens you only pass props and it renders the output. Stateless components have two main characteristics. One,they receive props which then render in the component body. Two,they must return a jsx."

    description: "Arrays Are very important part of any scientific programming. They can be worked on and formulated to bring alot of meaning to unstructured situations in our day to day life. Numpy is a well known python library that works with arrays. From a mathematical point of view,numpy is library built to deal with linear Algebra. Lets look and some of great features. To start with,You must have the module installed in your machine. Then in pycharm or Anaconda workspaces eg Notebook,import it using import numpy as np. Today we will just look at how you can do some basic manipulation to your array. By use of numpy,You can look for standard deviation,variance,mean,covariance and also correlation."
